"although yamato resolves to stay on track, he just can't seem to be able to catch the baton, repeatedly dropping it. to help yamato, miki decides to take matters into her own hands and train yamato. after many hours of practice, yamato still fails to receive the baton properly, due to suzuka occupying his thoughts the moment of receival. eventually, yamato reveals that his poor performance is due to his regret of lying to suzuka. miki offers to talk to suzuka about it, but yamato declines the offer, stating that he should stop making excuses and talk to her himself. yamato tells the truth to suzuka and reveals how valuable her friendship is to him. suzuka later calls him to say she is not angry anymore and encourages him to work hard at the track."

"travis convinces lily to let him produce one of her songs. travis is really tough but lily realizes that he is bringing out the best of her musical talents. the song is an instant hit in roscoe but lily freaks out when he airs and releases the single under her own name as opposed to shady lane. as the accolades roll in, lily learns to trust travis and they grow closer than ever. robbie and kim realize they have great chemistry when they debate issues against each other on cougar radio. kim sees the on-air potential and asks robbie to join her in a funny cougar radio segment. but it is hard to keep things light and funny when the gang has certain expectations of robbie, and kim's peers have certain expectations of her. the two of them must put aside their differences and concentrate on their shared love of radio. ray thinks lily and travis are secretly dating,but later he finds out the truth. also, lily does something she wasn't supposed to do."
