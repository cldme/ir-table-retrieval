"on the way home from running errands, mary hits a bmw, breaking the tail light. from the persuasion of rose, she decides to leave a note on the car. the next day, after no one has arrived to see the car, mary wants to remove her note. however, another car comes by and nearly totals it, but then drives away. before mary can get to the car and remove her note, the owner comes out of an apartment and sees her note. sandra tells mary that she needs to use her ""femininity"" to get out of paying for the total damages. mary says that she can't do that, so sandra poses as mary when the owner comes by to talk to mary about the damages. everything goes well until lester comes home and their lie unfolds. everything gets straightened out between mary, lester, and the car owner (marvin), ending with a date for sandra and a new friend for the jenkins. meanwhile, mary tells brenda that she cannot go skating with calvin because she lied.(this episode was taped after the pilot to add additional characters and provide background for those in the pilot episode.)"

(barrow speculates that the ground level may have been raised by the rubble of the old cathedral) a painting by charles lilly from 1790 and a print from 1789 show the round tower with a broken top standing to the south-west corner of the cathedral next to st. patrick's grave. the remainder of the tower is said to have been pulled down in the early 19th century during the renovation of the cathedral as it was in a dangerous state. no trace of the tower now remains but the site is pointed out next st patrick's grave on raised ground which barrow speculates may conceal its foundations."

"sandra introduces her boyfriend to the ladies, the same man that audited the jenkins. mary still does not like him, however he charms everyone and eventually wins mary over. rose decides to sell 227 to him because she is efficient with his building (across the street) and he handles some of the 227's problems. the next day, a man shows up saying that he is going to demolish 227, but the only one who sees him is mary. she blames mr. stone and tells the other residents. when rose confronts mr. stone, he calls the deal off before rose can say anything about the demolition, but mr. stone sends a building inspector around to persuade rose to sell again. when rose agrees to sell, all of the tenants meet in the basement, mary and sandra both sign the contract as witnesses, and mr. stone admits his true intentions to demolish 227 and build expensive high rise condos. the contract ends up being void because mary did not sign her actual name, but instead signed as ""daffy duck."" rose remains the landlord at 227."

"(bobby brown) shoots a video at brenda's high school, while brenda plagiarizes an old essay of mary's to win a part as an extra. brenda kept putting off writing it by going to pep rallies, football games, and parties with calvin at morgan state, and on sunday night, she still does not have her paper done. when mary wrote it (25 years earlier), she received an a+, but brenda gets a c and is not one the five chosen to appear in bobby brown's video. meanwhile, julian bribes travis into bringing bobby brown to his penthouse so he can discuss going into business ventures with each other. bobby brown decides that he does not want only five students to appear in his video, but the whole class. brenda is allowed to be in the video but she is still grounded and has to write 3 more papers for mary."

"the irs audits mary and lester. at a diner, mary gets into an argument with a man whose views on women are old-fashioned and clash with mary's views. she goes as far as to insult his mother. when she and lester are finally let in to see the auditor, it's the man mary insulted! she knows that she and lester are in deep trouble. mr. stone doubts the validity of their receipts and lester is upset. sandra bursts into the room because she has a date with mr. stone and wants to know what's keeping him. she verifies that a questionable dinner party was truly a party for lester's investors and employees. mr. stone lets them go."

"news of the breakup of her neighbors' marriage has mary worried that the same thing could happen to her and lester. mary plans an evening of romance for her and lester. lester buys flowers (at mary's suggestion) and they try to force romance by going out to eat, dimming the lights, and playing romantic music. but they realize that they only think that works is by letting it happen naturally and reminiscing about the past. meanwhile, sandra has to babysit her 6-year-old niece susie while her sister harriet and her husband visit his sick mother. she solicits mary's advice on what to feed her and how to get her to fall asleep.(this episode was taped after the pilot to add additional characters and provide background for those in the pilot episode.)"

"for a choir sing-off, mary has found housing for all of the competitors except one, and for good reason. he is rude, pushy and impatient. he winds up staying with the jenkins. he tries everything he can to guarantee that his choir will win, including taking the judges to dinner and bringing in a professional gospel singer. the d.c. choir brings in brenda, tiffany and friends to sing with their choir, which gives them a unique, youthful sound. the competition ends in a tie, where both teams will represent the east coast in the california semi-finals."
