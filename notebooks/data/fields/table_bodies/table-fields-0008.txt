"with maxxor and chaor trapped at lake blakeer by the master brainwasher aa’une, a devastating m’arrillian mind wave races across the overworld towards kiru city, where the helpless tribal allies wait in horror. aa'une knocks maxxor into lake blakeer. when kaz wonders what happened to tom, a contact from codemaster crellan reveals that the shutdown prevents the chaotic players from returning from perim. takinom and her fellow underworlders alongside the surviving overworlders arrive to help in battling phelphor's army. it turns out maxxor had iparu pose as him so that maxxor could find xerium armor. kaz arrives in kiru city as takinom's army fights the brainwashed army. kaz uses a psych-sphere (which he gained from ulmar's lab) to free tom, peyton, and sarah from the mind-control. tom and the others head to the kiru city library to recover their scanners. at lake blakeer, aa'une changes into his true-form: a multi-faced sea creature version of himself. iparu becomes a clone of aa'une's true form. tom and the others make it to the library. tom, sarah, and peyton find their scanners when a mind-controlled intress attacks. maxxor and chaor discover that lake blakeer is negatively charged. upon finding the real aa'aune, they use a positive attack to knock aa'une into lake blakeer. those who have been mind-controlled by the m'arrillians are free while the other m'arrillians retreat."

"the rockstars give a special performance to impress the students. they even say that they will form a song list according to the students of heritage high's choice. malini feels nihaal and koel are starting politics in school. the rockstars set to find a drummer for their band and decide that they will select a weak person so that the person won't hog limelight. they also insult loveleen and makes her do a silly dance. bikki warns them to stop teasing loveleen. priyanka, bikki and motu clean the music room as their monthly duties while addy, kj, malini and phsyco repaint the canteen tables. addy irritates kajal and makes her mad so she begins to do her job fast to get rid of them. kj begins to think that addy was missing sanya-tanya so he was troubling her. but there was a bet between pysco and addy to see if addy could make kj do her work. priyanka rechecks to see whether it is properly locked and keeps the key on the table as manager has gone somewhere. but, they soon find out that the musical instruments are stolen. the girls go to meet lekha ma'am but finds a new vice principal who decides to rusticate the pink band from the school because of priyanka's carelessness. stops on priyanka's face. note: co-starring: bhakti rathod as loveleen."

"the 93rd annual kamehameha schools song contest was held on friday, march 22, 2013. the theme for the 2013 song contest was, “he lei poina ‘ole ke keiki: a beloved child is a lei never forgotten.” the words lei (garland) and pua (flower), can poetically refer to children. although pauahi did not have keiki of her own, her aloha and concern for her people moved her to create the kamehameha schools for the children of the lāhui hawai‘i, her native hawaiian people. as we look to the future, as pauahi did over 125 years ago, we focus on the youth. this year's songs reflect the deep aloha that mākua and kūpuna—parent and grandparent generations—have for their pua. just as a child clings to its mother, so too does a beloved lei adorn the wearer. each of this year’s song contest mele was composed as a loving makana for a child. some are well known while others are making their debut. like pauahi’s never ending aloha for her people, these beautiful mele continue to express the composer’s love, hopes and dreams for a precious child. please enjoy the 93rd annual kamehameha schools song contest, featuring the theme he lei poina ‘ole ke keiki – a beloved child is a lei never forgotten.. the sophomore boys of 2015 began the men's competition with their song, ka pua u'i. the senior boys of 2013 sang next, with their winning rendition of he punahele nō ʻoe, capturing the george alanson andrus cup for the second year in a row. the junior boys of 2014 ended the men's competition with their song, pua hīnano. the junior girls of 2014 opened the women's competition with their song, pua mōhala. the sophomore girls of 2015 sang next, with their song kuʻu aloha e. the senior girls of 2013 ended the women's competition with their song, māpuana kuʻu aloha, winning them the new england mother's cup as well as helen desha beamer award for best musical performance. senior girls' director cali kinimaka also tied for the louise aoe macgregor leadership award. the coed competition began with the sophomore class of 2015 singing, he inoa no kaʻiulani, and sophomore leader dezarae le'i tied for the louise aoe macgregor leadership award, winning it for the second year in a row. the junior class of 2014 went next with their song, nēnē hanu ʻaʻala . the freshman class of 2016 made their debut performance of no ka lei tuberose ke aloha. the senior class ended the 2013 competition with their co-ed prize winning song, my sweet sweeting, winning the charles e. king cup for best coed performance and the richard lyman, jr. trophy for best use of hawaiian language two years in a row. men's competition: senior men of 2013 - he punahele nō ʻoe junior men of 2014 - pua hīnano sophomore men of 2015 - ka pua uʻi women's competition: senior women of 2013 - māpuana kuʻu aloha junior women of 2014 - pua mōhala sophomore women of 2015 - kuʻu aloha e co-ed competition: senior class of 2013 - my sweet sweeting junior class of 2014 - nēnē hanu ʻaʻala sophomore class of 2015 - he inoa no kaʻiulani freshmen class of 2016 - no ka lei tuberose ke aloha results"

(mr. b. make him refund the money.) in practice, lindsay sprains her ankle. when it comes to rehabilitation, she's afraid to put herself through a full workout. lindsay tells ryan that she doesn't want to take any risks and she won't compete in the finals. tommy leads the football players on strike in support of the girls' team. screech talks to lindsay and he tries to straighten her out. at the semi-final meet, the stands are full. maria and rachel both get excellent scores for their routines, then just in the nick of time, lindsay arrives in uniform. she scores a ""10"" in her event. bayside wins the meet and will go to the state finals."

"the gang arrives at sleepy mountain ski lodge, run by screech's grandpa ernie. business is very slow at the lodge because of competition from a big new resort, plus there's no snow for skiing. ryan shows r.j. a charm he plans to give lindsay during the trip to mark their relationship. rachel and maria are too nervous to talk to the lodge's handsome waiter greg, so lindsay speaks to him first. they seem to hit it off well. customers are leaving ernie's lodge, and even with a busload coming in the next day, he decides it's time to give up and close the business. the kids decide to help ernie out by being his staff for the rest of their vacation and the lodge stays open. ryan suggests lindsay help out in the kitchen, where greg works. working closely together, greg tells lindsay he's attracted to her; she confesses she feels likewise. they kiss but lindsay feels guilty. later, ryan gives her his gift. the new guests are ready to desert sleepy mountain when they hear the competing lodge has a snow machine, but by using fake snow on the windows and barricading the front door, ryan and the guys fool the guests into thinking they're snowed in, at least until the real snowstorm comes in a couple of days. lindsay tells the other girls about her dilemma and that she might choose greg. the guests find out about the snow scam, but the kids plead with them to stay, saying they were doing it all for ernie. the guests have been so entertained by the kids that they agree to stay and wait for the real snow. a troubled lindsay tells ryan about greg and gives him back his charm. ryan is hurt and angry."

"the dreaded teacher ""wicked witch"" hurst is giving one last killer physics test before leaving the school. tommy breaks a date with lindsay to study, so ryan jumps in and takes her out instead. later he spends half the night talking to her on the phone. the result is that ryan has done no studying of his own, so he convinces screech that it's ""national fire drill day"" in order to get out of taking the test. the sprinkler system goes off and all the homecoming floats in the gym are ruined. a new teacher, mrs. rumplemeyer, takes over the class, and she's even tougher than miss hearst. it turns out to be mr. belding in drag, trying to teach ryan a lesson. ryan works to repair the damaged floats and when lindsay asks him out, he declines—he has to study."

"a little girl from class 5d goes to nihal and tells him that she wants to join the music society and that she wants to stand for the elections. koel, as usual, decides to mean and rude to sam and sam cuts koel off by telling nihal that this fool keeps talking in the middle of their conversation and what the hell does she think of herself? but, she isn't allowed to run for the elections as she is too young. she is priyanka and the pink band's biggest fan and now decided to campaign for priyanka. all of kajal and priyanka's friends are very upset with them and do not know whose side they should take. kj freezes when addy says ""statue"" and he keeps talking about the elections. then, she tells him that this silly game of statue, and this topic are over for the rest of their lives. on the forms, it is required for the signature of a class 12 and a class 11 student. kj and priyanka go to amir for a signature but amir refuses to sign for any of them. now, koel is very happy that the best day in her life has come- breaking up of the pink band. priyanka gets cyco's signature and on the way to submit her form, meets shenaz mam who tells her that she heard about kj and her fight. kj gets addy's,{champu's} signature and meets sam on the way who gets her thinking. outside the music room, the two guilty friends meet- kj asks priyanka whether what they were doing was right. stops on priyanka's face."

"lindsay and ryan are celebrating one month together and they can't keep apart. but a problem arises when they audition for screech's production of the play ""cinderella."" ryan gets the part of the prince, but it's rachel rather than lindsay who lands the role of cinderella. rachel and ryan have to take extra rehearsals and lindsay can't help but be troubled. she suspects a romance is going on behind her back even though maria tries to set her straight. but later maria sees ryan give rachel a necklace and she reports this back to lindsay. what the girls don't know is that the necklace is really for lindsay, not rachel. ryan and rachel have to work on the kissing scene due to their height difference. when lindsay and maria see them, they think the worst. meanwhile the play is having troubles. r.j. is hamming it up in his bit parts, trying to turn the play into a musical. mr. belding, the director, doesn't like that but screech does, so mr. b. quits the play. all the cast members are getting mad at each other and are on the verge of quitting, too, but mr. b. gives a ""show must go on"" speech and everyone reluctantly continues. rachel tells lindsay the truth about what really has happened and reworks the play so that ryan puts the slipper on lindsay's foot instead."

"the 92nd annual kamehameha schools song contest was held on friday, march 16, 2012. the theme for the 2012 song contest was, “ho‘ōla lāhui, ho‘oulu pae ‘āina – vibrant people, thriving lands,” reflecting pauahi’s enduring legacy. much has happened in a hundred and twenty-five years since the founding of kamehameha schools. today, some 6,000 young hawaiians attend programs at three campuses located on different islands, with some 45,000 hawaiian learners receiving educational services throughout the community. supporting this tremendous educational legacy is a significant land legacy consisting of over 345,000 acres. the inter-relationship of people and land — of kānaka and ‘āina — is fundamental to hawaiian identity and central in hawaiians’ worldview. for the 2012 competition, some of hawai‘i’s most accomplished musicians and composers created musical ho‘okupu to celebrate pauahi’s lands and the vibrant communities that call them home. the sophomore women of 2014 opened the competition with their song, i keauhou ka ʻōnohi a ka lāhui by keawe and tracie lopes and arranged by zachary lum, a mele honoring the sacred sites of keauhou-kona, hawaiʻi. the junior women of 2013 followed with ka leo o waiālua, written by nalani choy and randie kamuela fong and arranged by aaron j. salā, which describes the incomparable beauty of waiālua on o'ahu's north shore. the senior women of 2012 ended the women's competition with their winning song written by keola donaghy and arranged by kenneth makuakāne, aloha keauhou, a song inspired by the diversity of the kīlauea rain forest of kaʻū. their performance won them the new england mother's cup and tied with the junior class of 2013 for the richard lyman, jr. trophy for best use of hawaiian language. the junior men of 2013 began the men's competition and took the prize with their song by dennis kamakahi, kamalō, the center of molokaʻi, and provider of many resources for the people of the island, with an arrangement by aaron d. mahi. they won the george alanson andrus cup for best men's performance of the night. the senior men of 2012 sang next with their song, waipā, written carlos andrade and arranged by robert cazimero, which speaks of this sacred land that helps us to thrive, and our duty to protect it. the sophomore men of 2014 rounded up the men's competition with their rendition of les ceballos' arrangement of ʻo waiʻanae kuʻu home aloha by kuʻualohanui kauliʻa and keʻala kwan, which tells of waiʻanae lands that give birth to resilient and proud hawaiians, from kaʻala to mākaha. the coed competition began with the senior class of 2012 singing, kakaʻako kuʻu ʻāina aloha, written by kaiponohea hale and arranged by les ceballos, telling of the efforts to bring back a hawaiian sense of place in honolulu's kakaʻako district. this performance earned them the helen desha beamer award for best musical performance of the night. the freshman class of 2015 followed with their song by manu boyd and arranged by zachary lum, nani heʻeia, a spirited mele which speaks of the ʻāina momona of heʻeia, where the palaʻa ferns thrive, and fish are abundant. the freshman director dezarae leʻi went on to win the louise aʻoe mcgregor award for best director. the sophomore class of 2014 went third with an arrangement by les ceballos, performing nani punaluʻu by kamakāne hopkins, a song that describes the lush land and thriving loʻi at punaluʻu, in koʻolauloa. the junior class ended the 2013 competition with their co-ed prize winning song, he aloha kaʻūpūlehu, written by līhau and kellen paik and arranged by aaron j. salā, which speaks of hualālai, where puna winds caress the body. they captured not only the charles e. king cup for best coed performance but also a tie with the senior women of 2012 for the richard lyman, jr. trophy for best use of hawaiian language. results"

"the day for the elections has finally arrived and round one is on its way. bikki got new posters to put up, but somenone had already put up banners saying vote for priyanka. this person was no other tham-samira! she told bikki that she is the junior campaign manager. koel gets her plan in action. the rockstars take up the challenge of a suggestion of a few words and compose a song, right then. lekha mam comes back from her 1 month long holiday and comes to know all about the elections. addy says something about pm and nihal and he have a physical fight. kj and bikki are really irritated with sam. round one of the elections is the question and answer round. as of now, according to cyco, the chances are 50-50. nihal is ready to thram priyanka and give her the greatest question that she will be unable to answer. buck up, get ready priyanka. stops on nihal's face."

"the codemasters have initiated an emergency order to recall all chaotic players and shut down the transport systems. while tangath toborn leads a group to glacier plains to attack the m'arrillian bases while m'arrillian coral fighters led by phelphor surround kiru city at the same time, maxxor plans to go the m'arrillian city of m'arr to capture aa'une and bring him to lake blakeer (a location that disrupts mind-control abilities) to negotiate a peace treaty. tom, sarah, and peyton encounter najarin who states that there is a traitor amongst the allied ranks. the battle between the m'arrillians rages on. tangath toborn struggles to find the symphony of stasis mugic before the heat cannon to melt glacier plains activates. arias and malvadine's group fights against phelphor and his coral fighters. najarin suspects that tartarek is the traitor and has tom, peyton, and sarah investigate. maxxor is rescued by chaor and helps maxxor get to aa'une. when the heat cannon fires at one of the glaciers, tangath toborn manages to use symphony of stasis to stop the flood, but it takes effect after he's engulfed in the water seemingly sacrificing his life in the process. as part of evidence to find out if tartarek is a traitor, kaz battles tartawrecker. maxxor and chaor confront aa'une. kaz finds evidence that tartarek has been taken over by the m'arrillians. maxxor succeeds in bringing aa'une to lake blakeer. najarin reveals to the tribal council that tartarek is with the m'arrillians and tartarek reveals that aa'une gets stronger at lake blakeer as aa'une assumes his second form."

"tom, sarah, kaz, and peyton discover that many chaotic players have made their way into the past. they pass the blame onto each other for letting the secret of dranikus threshold out. after repelling an attack from the underworlders, najarin angrily told tom and his friends to leave. once they did, najarin went from angry to depressed. back in the present, tom visits najarin stating that he never should've learned the secrets of dranikus threshold. najarin states that he shouldn't have snapped at tom. najarin then speaks of his assistant, afjak in ancient perim who used the portal of dranikus threshold and was never seen again after he overheard tom and najarin talking. klay and krystella, who feel going into the past is too troublesome, head into m'arrillian territory where they find lord van bloot shoveling coal into the ovens after he fled from the underworld. they inform lord van bloot about the secrets of dranikus threshold. their price is that no other chaotic players are allowed into the past and they themselves must be accompanied by bodyguards when they go on scan quests. with that knowledge, lord van bloot plans to use dranikus threshold to go back in time and conquer all of perim. najarin and creatures from the other tribes come to prevent this from happening, with najarin ultimately using the mugic location lament to destroy dranikas threshold. one of the final scenes shows tom and his friends overhearing a chaotic player inform others that a mysterious island has appeared, hovering, over perim. it is also revealed that afjak is najarin's son."
