"the return of the night master: many years ago, yo was the only woo foo warrior who was left during the battle against the world's greatest evil, the night master. yo used woo foo to defeat his enemy, but because of the amnisulet, everyone forgot that woo foo saved the world. now people make light of woo foo warriors. the night master plans to free his army from the spell yo put them under during a dodgeball tournament in the park. yin and yang see the tournament and ask yo if they can join. yo says no, adding that true martial artists don't use their skills in ways that bring up mad emotions. they enter the tournament anyway and get beaten by everyone they go up against. the night master appears in the shadows and offers them special training to use their woo foo skills with mad emotions. with yin and yang using mad emotions, the spell is broken for the night master's army. antagonist: night master and ultimoose pre-theme song saying: yang/ow! the pretzel!"

"a bad case of the buglies: yin has finally thought of a good insult for carl: he's bugly (because he's a bug and he's ugly). but carl isn't going to take this insult lying down. he shells out $29.99 for a repulsifier potion from saranoia and tricks yin and yang into drinking it. now yin and yang both look bugly (because they're bunnies and they're ugly). yang doesn't care about how he looks fighting evil, but yin does and she takes it really hard. antagonist: carl and ice monster control issues: master yo wants yang to learn self-control, but because yang won't learn it from him, master yo takes yang to learn from ultimoose, who claims to have turned over a new leaf. while yang is being forced to fight a giant monster until he learns self-control, yin has to figure out why her friends are acting so weird and stealing stuff. it turns out ultimoose isn't trying to teach self-control, he's trying to use mind-control on yang and his friends with the use of a magic hat. antagonist: ultimoose, master yo, roger jr, lena and dave pre-theme song saying: yang/i might have been poking something else."

"back when yang was still a jerk, yang promised coop that if he did him some favors, he would get yin to go on a date with coop. when coop comes to go on the date, yin makes it clear that she won't go on the date until coop starts acting evil again. master yo discovers coop's aura is split into half-good and half-bad, and the bad aura needs to be taken away. the only way to do that is with a magical set of suspenders and a bow-tie. master yo goes on a quest to retrieve the magical items and instructs yin to go on the date to make sure coop doesn't become evil. yang goes on the date, too to antagonize his sister, making her mad. when she gets mad, it makes coop mad, and he turns evil. his evil spreads to yin, making her want to be with the evil coop even more. yin is uneasy with hurting people and tries to stop hanging out with coop, but he makes her even more evil, and they go on a rampage. yang tries to prevent yin and coop from getting into the night master's lair until master yo can return with the magical items. yang has to battle with three incarnations of evil yin. antagonist: dark coop/dark yin pre-theme song saying: yo/stop looking at that.."

"fred feigns illness so he and barney can get out of taking their wives to the opera, as the night coincides with a bowling championship. using barney's home-made prehistoric helicopter as a means of escape, the two then join their bowling team for the tournament. they almost get away with their scheme, until loose-lipped barney gives away their night's activities by using a fake mustache him and fred used earlier to try to fool their wives at the bowling alley. notes: this is the series premiere. on this and many other early episodes, wilma and betty are depicted as domestically abusive wives. in later episodes, this happens only occasionally (those others included ""peek-a-boo camera"" and ""the buffalo convention"" for example); most episodes, however, usually show them as good-natured, but a little short-tempered. this is the first episode that betty was voiced by bea benaderet. barney sounds a little different than in later episodes, with a nasally-speaking voice instead of his deep voice."

"barney is mistaken for a scientist by some shady people. gazoo, meanwhile, gives fred a luxury car and this causes more problems, including the shady people accelerating the quest to get a secret formula from barney, who they think is scientist dr. rockinheimer. after fred makes the mistake of telling gazoo to get lost, they finally knock fred and barney out, and are ready to kill them to get a formula barney does not have. gazoo comes to the rescue and turns the ""horrorsorous"" into a puppy and the gangsters into babies. gazoo even drives fred and barney home with an invisible car. note: this episode has the longest opening scene in any episode that is 2 minutes and 14 seconds. (aka 134 seconds)."
