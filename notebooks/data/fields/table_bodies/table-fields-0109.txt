"when sam’s business professor announces a donald trump-style apprentice assignment that will see the losing team kicked out of class, she teams up with noah and they wrack their brains for the ultimate marketing plan. the plan they choose requires devon’s participation. although sam and he are no longer a couple, devon agrees to help, much to the annoyance of his new girlfriend, shannon. their assignment has samantha and noah working together around the clock and samantha starts to wonder if noah is the guy for her. noah also starts to have feelings for sam, but when he confides in devon, devon lashes out in a fit of jealousy. noah sets both of his friends straight. they are not over each other by a long shot. meanwhile, kathryn gets closer to beau, threatening his relationship with sloane."

"louise and saito enjoy some time alone as they explore a bazaar in the city of aquileia. henrietta asks vittorio to keep louise and tiffa safe but despite both his and julio's assurances agnes and henrietta still suspect trouble. tiffa wonders if she really did summon saito and notes that now seeing him makes her feel flustered. louise shows off her priestess outfit to saito and they begin to get intimate but malicorne ruins their moment. in gallia, bidalsha creates fire stones for joseph who reveals he will use them as weapons while sheffield confirms that she will enact her plan tomorrow. the next day after his eminence annual ceremony, tiffa tries to confirm if saito is her familiar by kissing him, but the two are interrupted by malicorne and montmorency. louise is taken aside by a peasant girl and when saito goes to look for her he is ambushed by bleu. the peasant girl reveals herself as janette, bleu's sister, and subdues louise and hands her over to sheffield. janette retrieves bleu and informs saito of louise's kidnapping, so he frantically searches for her to no avail. saito and the others regroup and tabitha reveals the kidnappers are from gallia, meaning joseph is behind the kidnapping. before they can act, they are informed that gallia’s airships are heading towards romalia. aboard one of the ships, joseph introduces himself to louise and tells her he will use her as part of his plan."

"sam is enraged when professor fisher makes a case study out of the crazed college girls (ccg) ceo, mick templeton, who happens to be a former business class student. kathryn and shannon are all over the ccg competition which offers an all-expenses paid trip to cabo. sam finds this raunch culture degrading at first, but when her uncle patrick lets her down one final time, sam tires of being the ‘good girl’, and agrees to join kathryn in the ccg competition. letting loose, leading men on, and dressing sexy is both empowering and fun, and sam and kathryn end up being the belles of the ccg ball. but when the competition takes a more exploitative turn, sam and kathryn bow out, losing the trip to cabo, but maintaining their dignity. returning home the next morning, sam bumps into devon coming out of dawn’s room. sam heads off in search of her uncle patrick and she finds him leaving for good and tearfully confronts him. moved by her pleas, he cracks and tells her the truth about her family history, putting his deal with dorothy in jeopardy. meanwhile, noah confronts professor grant about the secrecy of their relationship and eventually stumbles on the truth, that she is married. noah tells professor grant he cannot be the other man, and they are over. things are complicated when noah discovers that professor grant has left her husband for him."

"louise and saito are sent to albion and assigned a special mission by princess henrietta to attack the enemies` line of defense, the city of south gotha. the plan is to attack the town with louise's void magic to disable the enemy from engaging in battle and to prevent the death of innocent people during the crossfire. louise accepts the mission, but saito is reluctant to join the war because of what he had been told by the late mr. colbert. during the attack, louise is unable to perform her void magic; they are attacked by air fighters, and the zero fighter plane is forced to abort the mission and land in a snowfall. the queen must then send her army head on into battle. governor sheffield learns of a flying dragon made of steel (the crash-landed zero fighter plane) and arranges to have it recovered. saito and louise found an enemy air fighter named henry stalford who is badly injured and unable to fight, and saito carries him to safety and made truce with him. as the albion troops arrive to recover the plane and kill the enemy, the two are rescued by julio just in time. henry hopes to see the two again someday."

"in de ornielle, tabitha still hasn't decided if she wishes to be queen of gallia yet, illococoo says she wants to be married and have a baby before she becomes queen. louise and saito spend time with each other on a hill and they share a kiss. eléonore soon comes over and tells louise that she can't live with a random noble like saito and demands her to return home. louise then convinces her sister to let her stay by promising to have saito act like a noble. louise starts training saito for the whole day and the two inevitably argue, leaving saito sleeping on a busted lounge chair in the basement. later that night, as louise is worried in bed, saito discovers a hidden passage that leads to a secret room with a mystical mirror. he touches the mirror and discovers that it's portal that leads to henrietta's mirror. henrietta goes through the mirror and meets with saito. as louise explores the mansion to search for saito, she finds saito in the room where she sees him and henrietta kissing. her tears fall as she quietly leaves the passage unnoticed. saito tells henrietta that he truly loves louise and cannot accept henrietta's feelings. saito soon leaves to hear derflinger tell him that louise was there, crying, and saito ran off to find louise leaving on a horse. louise just smiled and apologized for not realizing his feelings towards the princess. at the magic academy, tabitha then tells louise that she would have saito as her husband. kirche explained to louise that queens (i.e. nobility) can't freely fall in love since they are often betrothed so she must honest with saito and tells her true feelings as to not put him in a struggle. saito is afterward seen on the hill again, thinking about going back to his world since louise is not there with him. louise comes back to saito where and confesses that she wants to be with him forever. saito happily tells louise that she is the one who he is in love with and they embrace each other."

"tiffania travels back to tristain with the group. while introducing herself to the queen, she is asked to remove her hat, and she reveals her elven heritage with her long pointed elf ears. although elves are shunned by human society, tiffania explains that she is in fact a half-elf: her mother was an elf who died years earlier, and her father was the archduke of albion. henrietta shows compassion for tiffania. they discuss sheffield's comment about other void mages. henrietta offers to knight saito again and he accepts. siesta then announces she is saito's maid by order of the queen, much to louise's frustration. tiffania is also revealed to be cousins with henrietta, and she stays at the castle until she figures out what she wants to do. saito, louise, and siesta return to the academy to a big celebration. guiche is now the captain of the student corps known as the knights of ordine, and as appointed saito their vice-capain. reynald, malicorne, and the ordine knights carry saito away."

"saito is ordered to sign a confession paper that states he took advantage of tiffania in the infirmary and will not touch anyone else's breasts, however, he refuses and insists that tiffania asked him first. as the girls thank the boys by showering them with gifts, guiche, gimili, reynald, and malicorne try to cheer saito up by having verdandi dig a peephole to the girl's bath. they observe as tiffania confirms to louise that she asked saito to check her, and louise worries about her response, but denies they are lovers. the hole is noticed and the girls swiftly find and punish the boys, except for saito who escapes thanks to tabitha, who then passes out. some dolls arrive and dance, as they do every night (they reminisce saito of his first dance with louise), and louise shows up. she asks saito if he peeped, and saito admits it but only because the boys dragged him. they reconcile and embrace until tabitha wakes up naked. louise then forces him to sign the paper again."

"as tabitha about to depart for gallia, the gensou siblings (jack, bleu, and janette) attack de ornielle to kill saito, so a battle between them and saito and company breaks out. as the battle goes on, a trio of elves sneaks in to capture tiffa, but saito confronts them. the fourth sibling, damian, appears and uses alchemy to cease the fighting, and one of the elves uses that magic with his own to capture both tiffa and saito. later, the two awaken in a desert oasis and meet their captor, a female elf named luctiana. at tristain, henrietta tells louise they cannot send a rescue party since romalia is handling the situation, but louise resolves to save saito anyway. luctiana tells saito and tiffa she is holding them to study human culture, and also reveals the reason why they were kidnapped was because tiffa is a void mage, a power which elves fear, and because saito is gandláfr. as louise prepares to leave she is joined by siesta and tabitha, who are then joined by the rest of their friends on the ostland. saito and tiffa try to escape, but are unable to since a magic binds them to the area. saito assure tiffa that they will escape, and the two decide to go for a swim in the oasis, where saito discovers a submerged fighter jet."

"sam is confused about her feelings for trent and she still has not told devon about their kiss. uncle patrick keeps calling with what seem to be questions about his pending kidney transplant, and sam’s compatibility as a prospective donor, but are actually his attempts to reconcile his discovery about samantha’s past. dawn is shocked to find she is cut from the play because of her injuries suffered outside of colony after the opening night party. already livid with sam over the trent kiss, dawn seals the end of their friendship. she takes her revenge by bringing sam’s kiss with trent out in the open, before sam has a chance to tell devon about the kiss herself. sam apologizes, and devon reveals that it is not the kiss that hurt the most, it is that she kept it a secret from him. meanwhile, trent is trying to push sam into admitting her feelings for him. at the end of a tension-filled night at work, a gang of thugs break into colony, and lock sam and an injured trent into a storage room while they ransack the premises. devon is filled with anger and jealousy when sam does not arrive back on time from work. he leaves her a voicemail message that causes sam to cut him out of her life, once and for all. also, patrick surprises dorothy with his news about samantha’s past."

"louise and saito are dancing in the grand ballroom after tabitha's coronation, with louise lost in the thought of saito's life-risking lifdrasir power. the next day, siesta walks into louise and saito's room to see louise sitting on the edge of the bed. agnes arrives and inform louise that she, saito, and tiffania are called on by henrietta. the queen tells them that the pope has requested their urgent help, and calls upon sylphid to escort them there. upon reaching romalia they see aquileia being engulfed in flames and are attacked by a swarm of dragons. julio rescues them from a fire blast launched by an enormous dragon and escorts them to romalia. the pope requests the trio's help to stop the legendary ""ancient dragon"" and asks saito to use his new-found abilities, to which louise objects. when they arrive at the location where they will confront the dragon, louise informs saito of the consequences of using lifdrasir's power, but he agrees to use them to protect romalia and louise. the accompanying army trap the ancient dragon in a valley, and the pope uses his void magic on the dragon and its army; it usually functions as a recovery spell, but has a damaging effect against entities of evil. tiffa uses her memory spell to stop the dragon's army. saito uses his powers to strengthen his eminence, but the ancient dragon possesses julio's dragon, causing it to move towards the dragon's mouth as it begins blasting them with fire. derflinger demands saito, draws him to absorb the attack, but the ancient dragon's power proves too much and derflinger shatters, propelling saito off the back of the possessed dragon only to be caught by louise and tiffania. knowing he can no longer fend off the dragon with his magic, vittorio shoves julio off the back of his dragon, rescuing him at the cost of being eaten by the ancient dragon."

"everyone regroups in gallia's royal palace to assess the situation: while the ancient dragon has stopped moving, but is not dead, and now with only two void mages the chances of defeating it is low. old osmond is called in to see if the dragon can be stopped, and he states that they may have a chance if all the nations band together, to which henrietta, tabitha, and julio agree to. saito awakens and, despite being depressed about losing derflinger, resolves to keep fighting, causing louise to fear for his safety. saito remembers the fighter jet in luctiana's oasis, but since it is run down, he and louise decide to use her world door spell to travel to saito's world (japan) and acquire a new one for the upcoming battle. using saito's lifdrasir powers, louise opens a door to japan, but when saito steps through, louise openly states she loves him for the first time and lets go of his hand till the 'door' closes, forcing him to stay in the safety of his own world. louise's friends watching this happen cry about her hard decision. everyone begins to mobilize, and osmond informs louise and tiffa that while the power of the void can defeat the ancient dragon, it consuming a void user will empower it, thus the two girls will be the dragon's next target. osmond mentions that the battle will be held at the magic academy since it has been evacuated, but upon arriving find out no one has left. all of louise’s friends, including siesta, luctiana, arie, and even the gensou siblings assure her they will fight together to save their world. back in japan, saito tries to return to hakelginia by visiting the spot from where he was summoned, but to no avail. the ancient dragon awakens, assuming a new form with wings and takes flight, obliterating the fleet that was monitoring it, and makes its way towards the magic academy, tiffania, and louise."

"at the magic academy, a ball is held in celebration of louise, saito, and the others deeds in romalia. louise and saito dance, and he expresses his wish to be with her forever, leading to a passionate kiss between the two. meanwhile in gallia, tabitha uses an antidote given to her by bidalsha to cure her mother. the following day, siesta overhears how tiffa tried to kiss saito and suggests to louise that they should separate saito from tiffa by buying a mansion were only he and louise would live, and louise agrees. louise rejects all of saito and siesta's choices, and becomes further irritated when siesta reveals she too will be living with them. things become worse for the girls when they discover saito has become increasingly popular with women due to his heroic status while at scarron's inn, and so decide to hasten their efforts. back in gallia, tabitha is asked by her mother to become the new queen for both the country and her father’s sake. three days later, agnes brings saito and louise to henrietta, who informs them that tabitha will be gallia’s new queen and to reward saito for his previous deeds with a portion of her territory. saito, louise, and siesta arrive in their new land, ""de ornielle"", only to find that it is a forest and their mansion is old and decrepit, but stay anyway since it was a gift. that night, the trio is visited by tabitha who reveals she will be moving in with them since she postponed her coronation."

"it is charles u’s winter semi-formal, which should be a magical time for samantha. the event is honoring dorothy o’sullivan’s philanthropic work with the school, but everything starts to go wrong. colony’s liquor license has been revoked for a month after a drug-dealing incident. sam is suddenly left without a job, or money to pay for her meal plan installments. just when there seems like no hope, dorothy offers her a way out: free room and board, living at her mansion. needless to say, sam’s friends at macdonald hall do not want her to leave, but the offer is too good to pass up, at least until alicia o’sullivan opens sam’s eyes to dorothy’s deepest secret. the big night arrives, and sam walks into the ball with trent on her arm, and a gracious dorothy ready to show sam off. sam even reconciles with dawn, and finally has her first real kiss with trent. sam’s uncle, patrick farrell, arrives at the party, seriously ill. he tells sam that dorothy promised him a kidney transplant in exchange for his silence, and then did not keep her word. meanwhile, kathryn gives an apologetic beau beecham one more shot, and lives to regret it when beau does not realize that no means no. also, dawn is offered a role in a movie. unfortunately, it turns out to be a movie version of bel air high, the tv show she went to boston to escape. dawn turns it down, but when her heart is broken again, she changes her mind and accepts the role."

"the group arrives in beautis, gallia's capital, and prepare for tabitha's coronation. while tiffania and saito are becoming closer, louise and siesta worry that tiffa might try and seduce saito. meanwhile, luctiana and arie are given a guest suite to stay in for the duration of the coronation. guiche and malicorne are asked to guard the two and stop them from disrupting the ceremony, but luctiana insists on trying to leave and explore, and while attempting to stop her guiche and arie begin to argue. saito arrives and asks for the two to get along. later, louise requests that saito help her get dressed in preparation for tabitha's coronation ceremony, and as saito nervously tightens her dress, he notices louise's breasts have grown slightly. louise asks if saito regards her as his only master, but before he can answer tiffania suddenly bursts in, asking that saito help with her own dress. sometime later, luctiana escapes the guest suite and guiche, arie and malicorne head out to look for her together. henrietta calls louise, saito, tiffania to the palace's throne room, where vittorio and julio are also present. after congratulating tabitha on her accepting the role of gallia's new queen, louise explains how her new void magic, known as the ""world door"", was used to rescue saito and tiffania, followed by saito revealing his new runes to vittorio who identifies them as ""liveslatille"", which allows him to boost the power of a void user's magic. while returning to their rooms, the trio run into kirche and montmorency and agree to spend a girls-only night with tabitha and illococoo to celebrate her upcoming coronation and their last night together. while going to tabitha's room, the four find guiche questioning a maid as to luctiana's location, with montmorency mistaking the situation as flirting. seeing how guiche and montmorency's relationship is similar to arie with luctiana, he and arie come to an understanding. the girls run into luctiana, and she and montmorency also come to get along. the following morning tabitha is crowned the new queen. while preparing for the party following the coronation, louise brings up her question from the previous day. saito states that his master is irrelevant, because his love is only for her. worrying that they'd be late for the party he goes on ahead, leaving louise behind. while searching for him she overhears a conversation between the pope and julio, discussing a consequential side-effect of saito's new-found familiar power: while his new runes give him the power to boost void magic, the user's strength gradually diminishes with every use, which would eventually result in the user's death. vittorio had failed to inform saito of this as he feared that the consequences would frighten him, as well as knowing that this power would be required to overcome a peril that could threaten the entire world. louise worries that she'll lose saito."

"siesta continues to annoy louise, but proposes to stop if saito can locate louise at the slepnir ball, a party where the participants disguise themselves as their ideal person by using the mirror of truth. the night of the ball, louise transforms into cattleya, while her classmates pick knights, beatrice and her friends chose tiffania; guiche chooses himself. on the way to the ball, saito sees a dark shape that flies overhead. he finds ""louise"" at the balcony and after some confusion over his ""continue where they left off"" remark, they embrace and kiss. meanwhile, sheffield disrupts the party and the mirror is broken. saito discovers he is holding henrietta; who chose louise as her role model, the two almost kiss again before louise sees them and runs away in tears. saito chases her, but is stopped by tabitha allied with sheffield, who attacks him. louise is confronted by sheffeld and allows herself to be hypnotized. saito eventually defeats tabitha, but spares her life. saito frees louise from the spell, but louise's anger causes her to fall. saito eases louise with a kiss but are surrounded by enemies, suddenly a wave of fire magic from the large dragon shape saved them: an airship with kirche and a living mr. colbert!"

"geeker, becky and noah travel a hundred years into the future and discover that mister moloch has gained control of geeker and used his powers to conquer the galaxy. our trio find an extremely elderly noah languishing in a cell, his mind addled by his long imprisonment. ""old noah"" gives them a few murky tips on how to foil moloch's plan, and they return to the present to fight a seemingly doomed battle to change the course of future history and save the galaxy."

"saito and company take refugee in the charming fairy inn while the search for them continues. a plan is created to use the ostland to fly towards germinia as a decoy, while everybody else goes across the gallia border directly. scarron provides disguises for them, while colbert, seista, gimili, and reynard proceed to liberate the ostland. siesta shows doubts at first of not having any powers but is encouraged by saito that she could still help. she hugs him so louise kicks him in the groin from behind. in gallia, joseph and sheffield uncover a massive object, which joseph calls jormungand, covered with pulsing veins with a single large eye. posing as a traveling circus, saito and company cross the border, while louise broods over no longer being an aristocrat, realising she only has saito left. back at the castle, using siesta as a distraction, gimili and reynard take out two guards and they board the ostland, after dispatching two more groups of guards. colbert quickly fires up the ostland, eventually ripping it free of the chains. agnes falls for the ploy, ordering guards to watch the germinia border. louise sprains her ankle, and saito tells her to rely on him, carrying her on his back. she wonders how saito can be so strong, despite being alone in this world. the ostland is eventually stopped by tristan dragon knights, and agnes nearly kills colbert upon seeing him. meanwhile, saito and the gang arrive in gallia."

"sam and trent continue to dance around their relationship status, are they a couple, or are they just friends? trent scores some major points with sam when he enlists the help of his lawyer father, avery hamilton, in sam’s search for information about her family background. on the surface, trent seems like perfect boyfriend material, and from a perfect upper class family. but appearances are deceiving. trent’s family is anything but healthy. trent has a vice of his own and when sam tries to open trent’s eyes to his addiction, he refuses to listen, leading to an ugly argument at colony. trent walks away and ends up hanging with alicia o’sullivan and some other drug addicted friends, determined just to “have fun”. the fun comes to a screeching halt, however, when alicia overdoses. luckily, level-headed sam, is there to call 911. sam draws a line in the sand, either trent cleans up or he has no chance with her. meanwhile, a suspicious professor fisher puts two and two together, and realizes the “other man” who has ruined his marriage is his star student, noah jensen. also, it becomes pretty clear to dawn that devon is dating her just to get back at samantha."
