"episode starts out with a godos being stolen and used to destroy its own base with a black organoid. in the morning, van goes to check out the base, or whats left of the base. van looks around the base and sees that it was a thorough job. whoever did this didn't want a trace of anything to be left behind. then a survivor tells van that this was done by a black organoid. in the back of his mind van thinks this couldn't be possible. he calls in thomas schubaltz. van and thomas had a talk with each other and van filled in thomas with all the details about the black organoid and raven. van thinks that that it might be a mistake bringing thomas into this mission. meanwhile, in the desert at the time raven was walking alone and a gustav pulled up and gave raven a ride and some water. then thomas says that taking raven down would be a piece of cake, and that he would win. raven isn't the raven that van knew back in chaotic century, he has been psychologically effected by the loss he received."
"after van had brought rudolph back to the campsite away from danger, he had seen the whirlwind of light surrounding the shield liger. before where metelinick and his thugs were left because of the damage they had suffered due to irvine's command wolf. they had just finished reparing the damage on one dark horn and the other would need at least a week to recover. then a red guysack shows up and a guy called stinger a.k.a. the fisherman shows up. meanwhile, van demands an explanation for what's happening to the shield liger. he finds out that fiona and zeke are still inside and he tries running into it but gets thrown away by the massive energy that was being put out. van then runs off because he wanted zeke to choose him, and wondered why he chose fiona instead. stinger makes a deal with metelinick in which he'll help with the destruction of the cocky-group of punks with the organoid. rudolph makes it over to where van had gone off, by some nearby ruins. denis was given the red guysack, to keep an eye on van, and do whatever is necessary to keep him away from the whirlwind of light. meanwhile, stinger makes a plan, in which the 2 remaining dark horns will attack him in order to fool moonbay and the others so they would trust him. in return he would poison their food so they would be paralyzed for a number of days. his plan works perfectly, except rudolph doesn't drink the soup he just gets caught. at the ruins, van starts to hear fiona's voice and she gives him a message to go back, while on the move van is caught off guard by the red guysack."

"after not faring so well against the geno breaker last time, this time they brought in colonel halford, used to work with major dan flyheight (van's father), halford is a complete jerk and lacks respect for anyone below him. he does have one good point that makes up for his ugly face, he is a geno breaker specialist. he analyzed all the aspects of the geno breaker, for example, it has a window of 1:05 seconds before it can recharge after the first particle beam. it also needs 5.33 seconds to charge the particle beam. in their strategy, they want to neutralize the foot locks of the geno breaker so it can't fire its particle beam. but what he doesn't realize is the geno breaker can fire from the air as well, it can use it thrusters mounted on the back, where the pulse laser cannons used to be, and boost and it wouldn't need a recoil because its in the air. then, thomas, irvine and van do some exercise and keep doing those over and over."

"after barely escaping from raven, van and the rest find some shelter. rudolph wakes up and was having a bad dream and wonders if he will ever get back home. later that morning, rudolph asks if they could take him to guygalos and teach him how to pilot a zoid. at the palace, minister prozen is sending out search parties and they are still looking for the prince as he explains to prime minister homalef. a whole herd of rev raptors and redlers are searching for the prince, but were taken down by raven and his geno saurer. van starts teaching rudolph how to pilot a zoid properly but rudolph needs more practice. then he gives rudolph some special zoid pilot training. they find a bunch of imperial redlers with their zoid cores ripped out and dr. d believes the death saurer was responsible for the damage and ruins of the redlers. dr. d tells everyone about the legend of beast of destruction, the death saurer. it goes: one death saurer, destroyed a platoon of 1,000 zoids and wiped out a whole nation in one night. they figured that raven has the death saurer, and is using its power to destroy the redlers. in the middle of the night, van couldn't sleep because of the death saurer and rudolph was about to run away. he was stopped as van stood in his way. they also find out that rudolph is the next in line for the imperial throne. rudolph also tells about the ambitions that prozen has to rule the empire and take control of it. shadow, raven's black organoid, shows up and kidnaps rudolph. then rev raptors show up, dozens of them. irvine gets in his command wolf and moonbay gets in the gustav and takes them on. while van goes after raven, he learns that raven's new zoid is a geno saurer not a death saurer. raven takes van on and in a couple of minutes, with the charged particle gun, raven blows the shield liger's core into smithereens. fortunately, zeke escapes with van, but the main point was that the shield liger had drawn its last breath."

"van and fiona are going through the desert and fiona gets thrown into a sandpit, as a red command wolf shows up and rescues her. since they had gotten separated from the shield liger and zeke, the command wolf pilot gives them corn and a place to sleep. by the time they wake up, he is gone. van and fiona make it back to the liger and zeke. later on, they find themselves in a an ancient fortress that was abandoned 50 years ago. a white gordos attacks them so that they cannot enter the ruins. both van and fiona find another way in, through a hidden sewer tunnel. when they make it out, they had gotten into the heart of the ruins. as they searched they found a diary of a soldier that said that they were abandoning this base, that they didn't want to leave their companion the gordos here, but that with his damaged leg he couldn't go on. while all this was happening, irvine (red command wolf pilot) shows up and starts to attack the gordos, with a barrage of headbutts and tackles, but he retreats due to some minor damage. after van fixes the gordos, fiona somehow manages to find an ancient tablet that made her remember something called zoid eve and that she was to find. then irvine shows up in his red command wolf and launches an assault in which van gets caught. fiona and zeke make it out. then irvine shows up again and threatens them. van shows up with the shield liger. they fight and though it is a tough battle, van is about to lose due to inexperience. then the white gordos shows up. irvine flees and van tries to tell the gordos that the war ended a long time ago and that they can be free, but unfortunately, the gordos doesn't listen."

"there's a parade in new helic city celebrating the republican's latest victory and irvine, moonbay, and fiona watch it. van and zeke wander away and see a lone imperial soldier being harassed by some republicans. the imperial soldier had escaped and was trying to get away from the city. van feels that the right thing to do is to help him, so he and zeke chase the republicans away. the soldier runs away and drops a picture of him and his mother, and van picks it up. he meets the others at a cafe and tells them what happened. irvine leaves for a moment and moonbay says that they should go to the institute that specializes in ancient ruins. just then, a few trucks pull up with republican guards in them and one of the them is the person that van and zeke had chased away (he had told the guards about how van helped the imperial soldier). the guards accuse him of being an imperial spy and don't believe that hermann gave them their letter that he wrote for them. irvine drives up in a jeep, throws a smoke bomb, and van and the others get in and drive away with zeke running after them. irvine drives until one of the tires on his jeep is shot, and then they start running. the run into a dead end, but then a guy wearing a frog mask that covers his whole head pops out of the sewer. he takes them down into the sewer while a balloon is released to distract the guards. irvine takes off the guy's mask and he turns out to be dr. d! dr. d takes them to the institute and they break in. they explore the building and find a huge rock pillar with ancient writing on it, like the one fiona was looking at when she first said 'zoid eve', but fiona doesn't remember anything and just gets a headache. then they are surrounded and captured by republican soldiers. meanwhile, a large iceberg is headed towards the city. a lady informs the president (president camford) about the prisoners, hermann (her son), and the letter (they can't confirm if it's real because herman is away checking out the iceberg). a guard laughs at van and tells him that zeke has been taken away and will be dissected. van yells at him and then the president and the lady enter. van yells at them too, but finds out that the old lady is the president and that hermann is her son. the president sees dr. d with them and lets them out. later, van and zeke meet up happily and the president asks dr. d to help out the republic in the war, but dr. d doesn't want to be dragged into another one. van and the others are looking at the city when they see explosions. the imperial soldier van helped has stolen a powerful modified command wolf and is fighting some republic zoids on the streets. later, van and the others look at the damage and van becomes really angry, drops the soldier's picture, and runs off with zeke. meanwhile, the soldier is running away from the city when he sees a shield liger ahead of him. van yells at him and the soldier attacks out of fear. van blocks the shots with his shield, and then knocks him over with his shield and the guy is thrown out of the cockpit. the soldier runs, but van leaps out of his zoid and chases after him. he jumps on the guy screaming and asking how he could do that. the guy says he was afraid and just trying to get away. van nearly punches him and starts crying. irvine and the others arrive and irvine yells for the soldier to leave or else, and he does. dr. d tells van that he did the right thing by helping the soldier, because a life is a life. it doesn't matter if it's a republican or imperial one. van still cries, though. meanwhile, hermann, in a pteras with two other pteras units, checks out the iceberg and shoots it to make sure everything's okay, but then he sees oil near the bottom of it. missiles are launched from the iceberg and snow appears. then the two other pteras units are shot down and hermann tries to contact new helic city, but can't (due to the jamming snow). hermann is then shot down. beneath the iceberg, there is a large imperial submarine. inside the submarine is prozen, planning an attack on new helic city."

"after retreating from the doomed capital, the republican and imperial forces have been going to wendeen lake. this is where the republican's secret weapon, the ultrasaurus was resting. a last-ditch strategy they will use to defeat the death stinger is under way. they are planning to awaken the ultrasaurus, a heavy carrier zoid, which would provide them with cover and firepower to take on the death stinger. colonel herman believes there is only a 50% chance the ultrasaurus will awaken. van talks some sense into colonel herman and eventually makes him realize, he has to believe in the 50% chance the ultrasaurus will awaken or it's hopeless. six power blocks of the ultrasaurus are ready for action and are functioning well to their maximum. moonbay got an idea to kick start the seventh power block of the ultrasaurus. meanwhile, the death stinger slumbering in the molten lava within a mountain, it blows through the mountain with a charged particle beam and sets out after the ultrasaurus."

"as the imperial army is getting closer, captain herman is swimming really fast to warn their side about the attack from the empire. while van, moonbay and irvine are planning their next move to the guerrial plateau. they also find out a general in the imperial army is also looking for it and will pay lots of money if they have any leads. madam president drops in on the mount osa base to check on how colonel kruegar is doing. lieutenant o'connell of the red river base wants to send out a search party to look for the captain. but the president denies their request. irvine, van, moonbay and fiona are having dinner while the lieutenant drops in and is really mad, he says that he will pay anyone enough money from the military to retire if they would steal a pteras and go rescue the captain. while on the imperial side, admiral prozen was making his daily report to the imperial king zeppelin. they talked for a bit on how he was going to deal the final blow to the rebels. then van and irvine alongside moonbay and fiona broke into the base and stole a pteras to rescue the captain. van and irvine both stayed at the shore just in case the captain makes it back. dr. d catches the three soldiers including captain rob herman. then van and irvine appear to rescue captain herman. herman tells the girls that they should tell the mt. osa base to about the attack. irvine also runs off and van/herman go to a nearby naval base. then raven blows the naval base up and challenges him. van accepts, and all the while moonbay had made it to the mount osa base. irvine warns major ford who is piloting the gojulas to make a retreat to the helic capital, because these imperial troops were just trying to get the attention of the rebels and the zg. on the battlefield, van and raven are having a pretty nice zoid battle, until the imperial army decides to attack them. then van runs away."

"after capturing captain sephers and healing up, van and the newly repaired blade liger were ready for some action. the blade liger repairs were all completed. van did a test run with the blade liger, and it turned out the blade liger was feeling kind of sluggish. van found out after dr. d explained to him, that all the motion systems were worn out on the blade liger when came here and it also seems that van has been running the blade liger well beyond its capabilities, so now the blade liger isn't good enough for van anymore. then dr. d shows everyone some of the semi-functional boosters, that may increase the blade liger's potential. moonbay tries to test the boosters out on her gustav how the would work, but it didn't work at all, it took the gustav all over the place. then dr. d attaches some functional boosters to the blade liger. before the test run, fiona wanted to talk about something very strange happening to zeke. but van told her he'll deal with it after the test run."

"van is told by captain o'connell, that he will be going to imperial territory, because a couple of thugs posed as republican forces are terrorizing nearby villages. while he makes his way to this village, he will be accompanied by another guardian from the empire, schubaltz. as van leaves his liger in the woods, he comes to town with zeke and fiona. on the way, zeke gets covered with red paint. van makes his way all around town and finds that people back here near the farms aren't evacuating. then, schubaltz shows up with his triple mini-shot cannon, 8-missile cluster, and 17 shot cannon dibison. he sees that zeke is red and demands that what is he doing. van tells him that he is van flyheight, and he has a silver organoid called zeke, but there was an accident and that zeke was covered with some paint. he then doesn't believe a thing until he grabs him by his shirt and sees his guardian force tag. then schubaltz fills him in on information about the attackers."

"after they made it out of the treacherous mountains, irvine and van are traveling some where. where they have a flash back about what happened up to the point. rudolph was dressed up as a girl called ramona to hide his true identity. van finds out bandits here, dressed as imperial soldiers, are robbing the village of everything and bring the cost of food up. back to reality, van and irvine were still traveling and irvine has two flashbacks, one where it was long ago maybe ten or fifteen years ago, irvine had sister named helena. the second flashback consists of irvine and moonbay running away from some soldiers, whom are thinking they are and its. they go off and hide in a church where sister alena sticks a gun at moonbay and irvine. van and the rest find out much about the really sick kids are being infected by a disease called gafki-carl fever, but the only problem is the vaccine was taken by some bandits. while, staring at the boy peter, whom is comforting his sisters hands, irvine recalls himself in peter's location and helena in rosa's place. irvine volunteers to get the vaccine back. he also tell van the story about his sister and he she died because of gafki-carl fever. they make it to the bandits territory and the plan is van will draw them out and keep them engaged in battle until irvine can sneak in and get the vaccine. van faces off against rev raptors and destroys most of them. then irvine makes it into the base and starts looking for the vaccine. then the red horns start charging out, and attacking van. knowing van, he over does it and makes everyone retreat into the hideout. the red horn leader finally learns what their objective was attacking their fortress. he launches a missile at irvine, but van and the blade liger, intercept it. irvine gets in the command wolf and leaves but is caught by surprise by a rev rapter. van comes around after he wasted the bandits in their territory and picks irvine up and makes it back in enough time to give them the vaccine. meanwhile, raven had taken out another fortress with a bunch of gordos."

"a scientist talks to minister prozen about the loading process of the new type zoid they had found and the other zoid to which they had made alterations to its zoid core. van and the rest were going off to the guerrial ruins. all the while, rosso and viola were safe for the time being, they weren't chased by the imperial army. they planned to ransom the young prince to the highest bidder in the empire. after such a long and hard struggle from the palace to the desert, rudolph was fast asleep. rosso and viola were about to have dinner, but then rudolph starts to escape. van, moonbay, irvine and fiona had made it to the guerrial plateau and started searching around the ruins. they had split up, van/fiona/zeke went one way and moonbay/irvine went around the other way. they had learned that someone had recently been here, after crossing a trapped line, irvine and moonbay were chased all over the ruins by a rev raptor. then the same had happened to van, fiona and zeke. barely hiding from the rev raptor, irvine learned the movements of these zoids were sluggish and they had to be sleeper zoids, later he was able to confirm that by spotting its computer in the cockpit. irvine also finds out that they had to be programmed not to fire, because it would damage the ruins. vna and fiona were still running from the rev rapter and were cornered by the rapter, they jumped off the cliff and the shield liger w/zeke had rescued them. then with a few swift moves, van takes out all the rev raptors with the liger's shield. meanwhile, rooso is having an exchange with metlenick, rudolph for money. he gets the money but throws it back and takes rudolph again. viola backs them up and they make a safe escape. meanwhile at the ruins, after touching one of the stone tablets, fiona remembers something called death saurer. later at the prozen's scientific lab, he calls in raven and gives him a new type of zoid, they had made some modifications to its zoid core."

"the gravity cannon is ready to go up against the death stinger, the only problem is that they must get the death stinger to hold still long enough for it to feel the full impact of the gravity cannon. the decision to use the delta formation is used. once the death stinger is in sight van, irvine, and thomas leave in their zoids leaving van as the back point of the triangle. they manage to get the delta formation completed, only this time when the get into the formation it creates a pyramid shield barrier trapping the death stinger inside. the cannon shoots, but just before it gets close enough to the death stinger it breaks the shield barrier and fires its charged particle beam, destroying the shell. the fighters come to the conclusion that if they take off their shields they can concentrate more energy on the barrier, the fight commences. finally they reform the delta formation this time concentrating every bit of energy on the barrier."

"van and the gang barely make it past the imperial army. the shield liger wasn't working too well either; its sights weren't aligned properly. then the zoids started to do something weird, and irvine finds out that they are in the valley of the rare hertz. in this valley there is a pulse that gets emitted that makes the zoids not work properly. zoids affected by the rare-hertz begin to take on violent tendencies and run out of control, usually destroying themselves. the proof was a very old godos which was rusted and damaged beyond repair. they put on their pulse guards which protects their zoids from the rare-hertz. unfortunately, when they are about to leave zeke is also affected by the rare-hertz. he looks sick. but then he becomes completely controlled by the rare-hertz and rams the gustav. he then fuses with the shield liger, damages irvine's command wolf, and leaves. moonbay fixes irvine's command wolf. van runs away after irvine tells him he can't use his command wolf. he keeps walking until the shield liger's tracks disappear, he then notices the shield liger on the top the cliff. he climbs it and falls down, when he wakes up fiona is there bandaging his wounds. irvine's command wolf performance was downgraded by 30%. van finds zeke and the shield liger. zeke fuses with the shield liger and attempts to kill van. then irvine shows up and traps the shield liger against the side of the raised cliff. zeke escapes and van chases after him on the hover board. after a little organoid vs boy duel. zeke falls down the cliff and van catches him by the face. at this time, zeke realizes that van is a true friend and returns to normal."

"as van and fiona enter another town, they go to the security office, to get the briefing for their next mission, but when they enter, they find out that thomas is already there. after a few moments of bickering and arguments, van and thomas decide that it is safe if they both go after the bad guys. during their briefing, they find out that a bunch of outlaws are in the mountains so that they won't let trade go by. in a nice scheme to get the outlaws out, thomas gets a gustav and makes beek operate it, while both he and van are inside the liger and dibson. the outlaws attack as suspected, but when van and thomas get out, they find out that the enemy is using optical stealth. they also find out that the ""outlaws story"" was just a decoy so that hiltz can do his ancient ruin digging. van and thomas go to their hideout, and just about when they are going to make their move, they are confronted by hiltz and his organoid, ambient."

"after taking out the desert heldigunners and getting zeke back safe and sound, van and the rest are trying to make it to the capital without any of the imperials spotting him. moonbay and the others are making their way through a village a called light town, where they learn prozen has announced rudolph is dead. then, if that wasn't bad enough, they have a road block set up just in case van and the others run by. they come up with a plan to smuggle rudolph past light town and into the heart of imperial territory. moonbay and fiona are in the gustav, while irvine, rudolph, van and zeke are making their way past the mountains on foot. moonbay decides to act like she's getting married and succeeds after lying half a dozen times. later, the soldier in command finds out they were being tricked, and irvine, rudolph, van and zeke were on foot making their way through the mountains. irvine hears the engine of maybe two or three redlers in the vicinity and tells them to be very cautious. the redlers deploy things called ""realga""s. as irvine was warning the guys, rudolph falls down the cliff onto a smaller cliff. van, irvine and zeke rescue rudolph, but they couldn't use zeke's thrusters because it might cause a landslide which may also give away the location of where they are at. they eventually get caught by the realgas and are put in a cell here they are taking pictures of them. moonbay gets stuck in the desert because her gets caught in a sticky situation. later at night, after van, irvine, and rudolph are trapped inside a cage, they are rescued by the same guy that van had helped in new helic city. they go back for zeke and are spotted, they start running an the guy gets them out. van and irvine along with rudolph and zeke make it out there. while the soldier makes his own tracks and plunges into the river and makes it to freedom. just as they thought they were in the clear, a whole herd of rev raptors were pursuing them and moonbay had just arrived at the location. van and zeke make it into the blade liger, and they completely annihilate all the rev raptors."

"after fighting the geno-breaker and falling over a cliff into a river van washes up in a shore. irvine, thomas, fiona and moonbay start looking for van, and had been searching for hours without a trace of him, the blade liger nor zeke. fiona sensed that van is in a valley, hurt and unable to move for the time being. irvine and thomas go into the valley, irvine spots the blade liger and zeke but no sign of van though. then zeke tells fiona the cockpit flew open and van fell into the river. van, alive and makes it to a village but the people there do not help him. then after passing out van gets some sort of dream. in a shock van wakes up and finds a boy named nichalo who helped patching him up and his zoid, t-roll. van teaches nichalo how to pilot t-roll really fast and smoothly. meanwhile, the imperial army division base is getting closer to the village of nordinance. thomas does some research on the village, it turns out 10 years ago the republican army attacked and destroyed the village."
[hyndburn_(uk_parliament_constituency)|hyndburn]
"after training hard for the arrival of the geno breaker, van had upgraded the booster on the blade liger. the upgraded booster made the blade liger faster than the lightning saix w/o a booster. reice has a talk about the geno-breaker and why it is red instead of being dark blue or black. it seems that hiltz must've done something to the previous geno saurer that made it come out red. also, hiltz is not interested in either van or raven, he just wants who wins. then colonel halford talks to the three pilots about the geno-breaker, and how it just finished attacking the lightning siax development plant of the empire and its next target is this base. he also has a talk with fiona, tells her to ask thomas and irvine to remove the electrical pulse generators and degrade the booster of the blade liger. he also tells fiona after that she would be working with the ancient ruins study team again with him instead of this guardian force team."

"after making a direct hit with the surface and surviving the hammer kaizer destruction, the death stinger made its way to new helic city. at traveling forty km per day, it would make it to the capital within two hours. the evacuations of the republic were mostly complete, only the south and west sectors remain. emperor rudolph reassures the president, the defense forces of the empire will be arriving to give assistance, among them will be colonel schubaltz's armored panzer division. colonel herman gets an idea to sin the death stinger into molten magma, with some strategic bombing the crust will break and the death stinger will fall into the magma. van is still battling it out with blue geno saurer, reice. while, raven is still mourning the loss of his organoid, shadow. as irvine and thomas were making it to the storm sworders for the bombing run, the death stinger changes course and starts heading for the molten lava himself."

"barely escaping and making it to the front lines at the new helic shore, the republican army stands and waits for the imperial army to attack. prince rudolph of the empire has some bad news about his grandfather. while prozen gives the republican president a final ultimatum of surrender or be completely annihilated. then the republican army finds out more bad news, old man krueger, moonbay and fiona are still at the mount osa base. colonel krueger has an idea of destroying the mount osa base so the empire can't get its hands on it. moonbay, fiona and the colonel escape through the pteras. but the explosives didn't explode. so the colonel comes thinks if he blows the volcano up, the base would explode and all the combat systems on the zoids would freeze. dr. d was also thinking the same thing. they would fly in with just a couple of pteras alongside van and zeke. rudolph is informed the current emperor zepplin passes away at exactly 11:00 am. then colonel krueger, fiona and moonbay launch the missiles and fail, they needed more missiles if they were going to pull this off. then raven shows up with his saber fang and blasts them. van and raven duke it out then dr. d and his members of the pteras team make the volcano explode and the base explodes along with marcus. then prince rudolph orders an immediate ceasefire between both nations. then in the fight, van had managed to destroy raven's saber fang, but shadow pulls raven out of the saber fang before it explodes. the imperial army starts retreating and the republicans' pull a strategic victory over the empire."

"after meeting success at red river, the gang thinks that if they make it to the republican capital they may find a clue to zoid eve. before they leave captain herman gives them a letter of introduction, while irvine tries to take zeke, but fails. moonbay and the others stop by a near village to load up on supplies. moonbay and the others go out to get some supplies. irvine, fiona and zeke get separated from van. meanwhile, fiona goes on a shopping spree for fruit and makes irvine pay. van and moonbay get tailed by rosso's gang and chased all over the village, and finally get caught. irvine hears a gunshot in the village. he rushes and finds out that moonbay and van have been caught, they have been trapped and are tied around the shield liger's foot. fiona tries to untie them but also gets caught, but irvine manages to get van and moonbay free. van and zeke get in the shield liger. then, rosso shows up in his red horn and launches a devastating assault with all of his weapons on the red horn. van survives after learning that he could put up a shield with the shield liger. he then rams the red horn and rosso does the same. van and the rest of the gang leave because the imperial army shows up. rosso surrenders to the army only after telling everyone of his gang to leave. rosso gets caught and tells van not to get caught because he defeated the desert alcavaleno gang."

"after van starts coming back to the campsite, he is attacked by denis in the red guysack, denis tries to overtake him, but van manages to win by opening the cockpit of the guysack and knocking denis out then taking the guysack to fight at the other two. then stinger has all three, irvine, moonbay, and rudolph tied on a pole and is playing some sick games with their heads. later, stinger reveals he wasn't doing this for fun, he had a defined objective all along. he wanted zeke for himself, and whatever else he could his hands on. stinger then tells irvine to call out the organoid, but irvine tells stinger, zeke would never take orders from him or moonbay. he would only obey van. meanwhile, van had just started a fight with the dark horn piloted by rhoto. van takes him out with an attack from underneath and leaves. at the whirlwind of light, dr. d comes out and punches stinger and metelinick. then metelinick gets inside the dark horn and starts to attack rudolph, and just as he is about to hit rudolph, van shows up in the red guysack. then stinger comes out in a light pink saber fang completely loaded up with ammunination and takes out the guysack easily. then rudolph starts using irvine's command wolf and attacks stinger. in an attack from the saber fang, van is thrust into the whirlwind of light where the shield liger is resurrected as the new and improved blade liger. with one move it takes out stinger and then metelinick escapes in the dark horn with imperial ring of guylos. moonbay winds up punching stinger in the face, and both fiona and zeke make it back after resurrecting the shield liger."

"van is a young boy living in a small village on the planet zi. inspired by the sacrifice of his father to protect their village, van dreams of one day becoming a great zoid pilot, constantly searching nearby ruins for a zoid of his very own. he is attacked by desert bandits while on his hover board one day, and is forced to take refuge in the ruins he has been in many times before. the barrage of the attack causes a previously undiscovered door to fall off its hinges, leading to a room with two mechanical cocoons. upon activation of the first one, the organoid zeke emerges, is quick to bond with van, and together, the two are able to fend off the enemy attack long enough to escape the ruins. zeke is able to merge with an old, rusted out shield liger, rusted after decades of neglect by resurrecting it to like-new condition before using it to help van defeat the bandits in three on one zoid combat. upon their victory, zeke and van return to the ruins, activating the second pod, thinking it would be another organoid like zeke, but much to their surprise, a girl with amnesia named fiona emerges. with his new zoids and mystery companion in tow, van sets out to discover her identity and become a great zoid pilot like his father before him."

"it was raining and the first division of panzer unit in the imperial army made to a supply base that held more than 250 megatons worth of explosives. it was an urgent call made two days ago, and the commander of the first panzer division was no other than karl schubaltz. after checking part of the base, he was trapped with all his men. he found out that they were all being controlled by reice. after long and hard fighting by colonel schubaltz, he gives in. thomas calculates that the cooling valves have been closed so that there would be an explosion that would wipe out the respectful parts of both nations. in the morning, thomas finds out that his brother is in there, and both him and van go in to shut down reice. van goes in through without his blade liger on zeke. then reice captures fiona and uses her organoid, specular to control the iron kong. van and thomas make great time until thomas runs into his brother. thomas starts a fight with the kong."

"plot: after going head to head combat with raven, thomas's dibison is completely totaled and barely makes it near to a familiar gustav. van does some simulation tests at a nearby base to prepare for raven's arrival. the normal routine, couple of pteras' and command wolves. then in the middle of the simulation irvine shows up in his red command wolf, and challenges van. after a vicious duel at the first, both irvine and van stop and try to wash on a nearby lake. irvine tells van that he made a heap of prize money in winning a couple of tournaments and then he relaxed for the past couple days at la fray beach. when he heard of raven coming back he started coming to this base. then just before they are about to start round 2 of their duel, dr. d drops in with a parachute coming straight from the wind colony. he said that there was a way to strengthen the shield on the blade liger by at least 2 or 3 times. unfortunately, raven hammered his shield and before he was able to finish van, shadow took the geno saurer away from the battle. raven was angered by this until he witnesses shadow form an evolution cocoon around the geno saurer."

"after getting away from the treacherous mount iselina, van and the gang made it into republican territory. they make it to a village only after going through a zoid graveyard of 30 guysacks. van and the gang get in trouble as a few soldiers try to arrest them because they think it's someone else. van and fiona escape but irvine, moonbay and zeke are caught. then they are chased until they come across a boy lying down. the boy rescues them from the republican soldiers. more of them come, and as they are about to reach them, fiona grabs the boy (who is just as old as van/fiona) and they make a break for it. both moonbay and irvine are released due to a misunderstanding. major ford, leader and commander of this unit fills both irvine and moonbay in on the details. two days ago, an entire sleeper battalion was whipped out because of one saber fang and a black organoid. a black organoid similar to zeke had attacked them except it had wings instead of boosters. raven (the boy) leads van and fiona to fresh water and asks them how is he can rescue their friends. irvine gets to van and warns him about raven. by that time, the republican army has come in a small battalion of godos'. raven takes care of all of them. after that, van takes on raven and fights him. raven is a superior fighter and defeats him but has enough sympathy to leave them be. he leaves van with his broken pride."

"after van finally revives zeke with the zoid magnite, zeke needs some time to recover. major schubaltz joins and the imperial unit is delayed due to an avalanche of rocks. the delay is really severe they are delayed at least 2 hours. marcus believes that it had to have been a fluke. major schubaltz on the other hand believes this was no fluke, it was the work of colonel krueger and that he knew exactly what he was doing. the severe losses due to the chronos fortress and this delay with rocks was no fluke. it startes to rain and the roof starts leaking where van and the others are at. colonel krueger gives the command of mt. osa base to major ford while he pilots the zg (gojulas) onto the front lines. at only fifty-percent of its true capability, the zg still has firepower equivalent to twelve zoids. irvine sneaks into the base and sees just what they are planning for the upcoming battle against the empire. the advancing imperial unit is caught by surprise with several sleeper guysacks. the iron kong, under the control of major schubaltz, takes out all the guysacks with just one round of its 70mm chain guns. up above them under the cover of thick storm clouds, four pteras' under the command of captain herman from red river base comes here to assist with the battle. back at the deserted village van asks dr. d where he can find irvine. with some reluctance dr. d tells van that he is at the mount osa base. van quickly gets in the shield liger and runs off to rescue irvine. while in the mount osa base, irvine and colonel krueger are having a pilot to pilot talk with each other about the zoids. captain herman arrives at the base with his pteras squadron, but instead of colonel krueger, captain herman will be piloting the zg. the advancing imperial unit makes it to the mount osa base and starts attacking them, but unfortunately, colonel krueger is caught in one of the rounds and is hurt. fortunately, it's not bad. herman jumps into the cockpit of the zg and starts his one-zoid barrage against the imperial army. van makes it to the base safely and rescues irvine right before he falls to the ground. he also learns that he doesn't need zeke to access the power of the shield liger, that he can do it on his own. as raven looks on, herman takes out most of the imperial army forces, until major schubaltz starts retreating. after that herman grounds the gojulas."

"van and co. are traveling along when they come across soldiers of the helic republic, who mistake them for imperials, especially after registering the earlier explosion. they take them prisoner after a scuffle and impound the zoids. irvine reveals his true resourcefulness when he uses a hidden trick to break himself out and van along with him. van promises to come back for the girls and takes off with irvine for the zoids. zeke and the liger merge and van and irvine take off through the base. the republican soldiers mobilize several petras and try to stop them. out of the base, van tries to lose the soldiers among the crevices, but when he's backed into a corner and goes for the ammunition he finds out the zoids were stripped of their firepower and is chastised by irvine for his stupidity. irvine tries to figure out a way to save his own skin when van gets an idea and starts running the liger at the walls of the canyon. he bounces from side to side gaining altitude, and finally clears the canyon, taking out two of the republicans following them. he makes a try for the third, piloted by capt. herman. irvine, showing that he's actually beginning to like the kid, offers a hand, and coordinates jumps with the command wolf so that at its peak jump from the canyon the liger could jump off it and strike herman who thought he was just high enough. the pilots of the petras bail, and as he's floating down herman makes a respectful note of van's achievements. the episode ends with major schubaltz of the empire preparing his forces for the assault on the republicans at red river, and irvine scouting around."

"after saving the village from the desert alcavaleno gang, the shield liger had some pretty serious damage. van almost has a heart-attack when he finds out that fiona ate his papaya. a little while after that, they meet a sassy girl called moonbay. she checks out his shield liger and sees that the front-back leg had some missile damage on it. they talk until a couple of sleeper guysacks attack them. with moonbay's gustav weighted down by the heavy load, she can't put any weapons on it. just then, irvine comes and saves the day again by destroying all of the guysacks except one that managed to slip by and cause him some damage. moonbay finds a good place to camp out for the night, an ancient fortress base. both the command wolf and the shield liger had taken on pretty serious damage. irvine gets suspicious and asked moonbay if her cargo had any imperial firepower. moonbay verified that and told irvine that it was all loaded with imperial arms and that they would explode if anything hid it. at dinner, van tells moonbay and irvine what they have been doing. van, fiona and zeke go off for a treasure hunt and wind up swimming. during his swim, van finds the remains of a zoid. irvine goes to get his electromagnetic whip to get zeke and just then more sleeper guysacks start attacking. irvine figures that it was a sleeper trap. the guysacks they fought earlier were just decoys that led them into the ruins so that they could be surrounded very easily. the remains that van saw were one of its captured prey that the sleepers successfully defeated. moonbay took her cargo and went out the back with van while irvine made a complete 360 and came around. there is a fierce battle with just two zoids against more than a battalion of sleepers. moonbay drives half of them her way. then van and irvine show up again but this time moonbay decides to jettison her cargo and she leaves. when the guysacks start attacking the ammunition it blows them all up. moonbay returns and asked van to be her protector."

"after defeating stinger, and his saber fang stinger special, van and the rest continue their journey to guygalos. metelinick gives minister prozen, the ring of guylos. then van and the guys are talking about how they are going to get rudolph back to guygalos. stinger makes it to a bar in a village, where he tells the crossbow brothers to immediately make their way over to where van and the rest of the gang are in desert heldigunners. dr. d finds out fiona is an ancient zoidian, a lost race of people that were thought to be wiped out a long time ago by the death saurer. meanwhile, raven is heading off to destroy another fortress of the republican army. at the palace, minister prozen announces to everyone rudolph has been assassinated by an elite squadron of republican forces and then takes the throne. raven attacks with the geno saurer and the fortress responds with several gordos, but raven was unharmed, and within 3 minutes the base in complete ruin. then the cores of the zoids were ripped out and taken away. moonbay and the others were traveling, as the desert heldigunners under the command of the crossbow brothers take out zeke but zeke escapes and fuses with the blade liger. the command wolf was attacked by the mini-blades on the tails of the desert heldigunners. van takes them out with ease using the combination of the booster and blade attack. meanwhile, at prozan's ancient ruin study lab, they put in some zoid cores to awaken the death saurer."

"after taking down phantom, before he could kill emperor rudolph, captain o'connell and colonel herman are looking at the remains of the gun snipers that van destroyed. thomas and beek were looking around at the place where the geno breaker was first born in search of residual radiation. they are wondering how a gun sniper could change shape with just fusing with an organoid. colonel schubaltz made it to the dragon head base and they all, including thomas, make it to the briefing. dr. d started the briefing for the various enemies more than the guardian force had to deal with. then dr. d goes over the biographies of the following enemies they have had to tangle with. first they start with a man called hiltz, then they go on to, ambient, reice, specular, then finally raven and shadow. after that briefing was over, fiona had done a special briefing of her own on the top members of the guardian force and analyzes the best tactics the guardian force can use against the geno-breaker."

"the final battle between van and hiltz has arrived, but fionna keeps seeing prozen. reice, flying on specular, appears in front of prozen (raven, reice, and their organoids were awakened when fiona opened the gate to zoids eve). it's obvious that reice is no longer taking orders from the dark kaizer. just when the evil man is about to give her one of his energy blasts, raven appears in the geno breaker. they exchange angry words, and prozen sends three geno saurers to attack. reice watches tearfully while raven battles with them. suddenly, stray gunfire hits the building holding zoid eve causing it to activate. the death stinger begins to glow. meanwhile, lt. o'connell is flying overhead sending aerial photos back to the ultrasaurus. captain herman notices that the death stinger is resurrected. also in the skies is prince rudolph and a group of whale kings. rudolph sees a picture of the dark kaizer and immediately recognizes him as prozen. on the ground, van watches helplessly as the death stinger."

"after somehow defeating the whale king, van and thomas find themselves in a mystery. some people are stealing zoid parts which are still being developed. the weapons have their clear advantage, after finding it out against a couple of heldigunners. meanwhile, a gustav carrying stolen zoid parts from both respective nations stops after it drops some of its cargo. irvine piloting the lightning saix sees they could use a hand and jumps out offering assistance. irvine finds out what they are carrying and demands an explanation but before that happens, he gets knocked out. he turns on his one eye video piece. he captures the general's face and is later used for military intelligence. when irvine wakes up he finds out he is being accused of stealing the zoid parts and also his lightning saix has been stolen. after the officer in charge denies every one of his statements, they board a militaristic brown hammerhead."

"van, irvine and thomas are making some adjustments to the attack booster. it seems they attack booster can be upgraded to make the blade liger go several times faster. which would increases the chances of defeating the geno-breaker. in some cliffs, hiltz and ambient are about to release an ancient type of zoid. at the base, fiona senses the heat signature of this crude zoid and rushes off. then hiltz reports to the dark kaizer as hiltz is talking to the dark kaizer, raven drops in on hiltz and after a few seconds leaves to the top of the mountain and looks at the stars. he vows next time van and him meet that one of us will die. fiona has a very bad dream and finds what she went looking for. at the base, van went to try out the enhanced booster while, moonbay, thomas and fiona flew off in the pteras' and dibison. later on, van and irvine prep their zoids for battle as they hear raven is approaching in the geno-breaker. moonbay, thomas and fiona arrive at the cliffs to find hiltz has unleashed an ancient scorpion type zoid, the death stinger. thomas's dibison unleashes its strongest attack against the resurrected zoid and fails. finally, while van, irvine, and raven are fighting at a base, the death stinger fires a beam from the charged particle gun aimed directly in their path. after the beam is fired the geno breaker takes severe damage and crashes. the story ends with shadow overheating from being attached to its zoid core and hardening into a stone statue with raven holding it in tears."

"after van loses the battle to raven again, we find out that zeke is hurt badly this time. colonel krueger knows its a huge blow losing the fortress, but he wants to know how much time it would take them to start advancing again. he estimates about 30 hours and tells major ford of chronos unit that he should get back to mount osa base and prepare for a counter-attack. meanwhile, at the deserted village van tries to find help for zeke. dr. d shows up trying to find sunscreen and van gets dr. d to see zeke. dr. d. tells van that to revive zeke he would have to go to mt. osa and get a bright blue rock called zoid magnite. irvine goes to the republican base to get armed with a multiple missile diffusion systems. he gets to test it out. van and moonbay make it to mt. osa volcano and are struggling to keep alive and get the rock. in the meantime, irvine takes on raven and his saber fang with his multiple missile diffusion system. van tells moonbay he see the rock and she should lower him down. he gets the rock and gets pulled up and both van and moonbay get out of there with a second to spare. irvine traps raven with the needle missiles and raven fuses with his organoid and takes out irvine in a flash. meanwhile, the combined forces of the schubaltz and marcus unit make their way to mount osa base."

"after van loses to raven, he sits down and says he's waiting until raven shows up. some of the villagers warn them of the advancing imperial army. major marcus tells major schubaltz of the new objectives and different strike plans. major marcus's unit will attack and capture the chronos fortress and the schubaltz unit will advance on to mount osa base. after snooping and sneaking around irvine learns even though the republican army is backed into a corner, they have a bold strategy. after several attempts by moonbay and fiona, van still doesn't want to go. he is trying to pull the full potential of the shield liger out. meanwhile, in the village raven explains the strategy to major schubaltz, and asks him why they couldn't merge their forces together. it would be too overwhelming for the republicans and might force the president to negotiate a ceasefire treaty between both nations. after his talk raven leaves with his saber fang and shadow. van finds him and says that he wants a rematch. irvine, as always, is standing by if van needs help. for a couple of seconds, it looked like van has the match under control, but then raven, still being the superior pilot, quickly figures his strategy out and rips the dual-gun mounted on the shield liger off. then irvine comes charging in but raven takes him out easily enough. van puts up his shield and charges for raven; he hits his saber and raven goes down. he then fused with his black organoid, shadow. he takes van out with one blow and after that zeke is hurt pretty bad. the chronos fortress falls and blows itself up along with the part of marcus's unit."

"after making it snow, van and the rest head off to mount iselina. mount iselina is known for being treacherous. meanwhile, viola and jarro are making plans to attack and get revenge on van. in the middle of the fog of mount isolina, van stops everyone so he can get his flying papaya, irvine and fiona go after him and get lost. moonbay tells van about the shadow monster story. then some sort of shadow monster appears, it turns out that it was just the shadow of a godos that was being piloted by a girl named rosa. viola and jarro strategize that those punks (van) would be at the colony that is in the middle of mt. iselina. rosa takes van and moonbay to her colony, and that is where van stocks up on food. the villagers are surprised at what kind of strangers these people are. they are also fascinated at the zoids that they carry. then, van and rosa talk for a while and exchange stories. viola and jarro get there; they didn't want to attack the village so they lured van into a gorge with a lot of fog. van quickly takes out jarro the pteras pilot with the same maneuver that he took out captain herman, with cliff to cliff jump maneuver. he takes out viola with the help of rosa and the godos. then rosa and viola have a sister to sister talk and van is surprised that viola is the sister of rosa. van covers for viola and then leaves. then, moonbay and van find irvine and fiona and they leave."

"raven starts to rush after rosso and enters a punk guys territory called brad. raven being the nicest i have ever seen him, gets mocked by brad. then raven takes brad out and crushes his dark horn. later van and the rest were talking about how it was a waste of time, and irvine brings up a good point about how fiona remembered something called death saurer. van kicks a rock in the bush and finds a boy named rudolph. rosso and viola can't find rudolph anywhere and went searching for him. moonbay tries to swindle rudolph out of his imperial ring but van cancels that transaction. while at the imperial palace, prozen gives a magnificent speech on how, if prince rudolph doesn't return before the funeral of the late emperor zepplin, he would take office. a very fast zoid attacks through the cover of the forest, viola goes to check it out and it turns out it's raven in a geno saurer (purple/dark purple/black). rosso was coming to but he'd be a little late. rudolph was just leaving and was stopped when fiona creeped everyone out with her little forewarning. raven shows up and launches his charged particle cannon at viola and launches another one between the command wolf and shield liger knocking them down. raven attacks van and irvine, but it proves too much for our young heroes. he zoid is much stronger than any of theirs. the shield liger's ultimate move had no effect against the charged particle cannon. rosso and viola show up in the iron kong and try to hold off raven so that van could escape. raven destroys the iron kong and then stops his pursuit of van and rudolph. he said it would be more challenging if he gave them a head start."

"realizing zeke is an organoid, the desert alcavaleno gang decides to steal him in order to give him to ""a certain somebody"", attempting to regain some unknown former position or rank. meanwhile, fiona continues to annoy van with her constant questions, naiveté, and point blank uninformed honesty as they return to van's home village. he introduces zeke and fiona to his sister maria as well as the rest of the town, explaining how they both emerged from pods, and how fiona had lost her memory. the bandits attack when van is out giving fiona a tour of the area in the liger, taking maria hostage in exchange for zeke. feeling trapped, the townspeople don't want van to get hurt like his father, so they tie him up, and take zeke to the bandits themselves for a hostage trade. van gets free thanks to fiona's naive nature (she unties him simply because he asked her to!), and is able to come to the rescue of all three of the townspeople now in jeopardy, including his sister. before he can merge with the shield liger however, the liger gets damaged, and zeke is knocked unconscious. before the liger is destroyed, zeke is apparently awakened through some mysterious ability of fiona's. after the battle, the townsfolk accept his choice to leave his town in his new role as a zoid pilot, following in his father's footsteps while they chase after fiona's memories."

"van is told that soldiers are after the republican gold. he goes to the city and has lunch with the republican commander. the commander tells them that they are indeed searching for something. they are searching for explosives that had fallen of during the war. since they couldn't do much in the past they started doing it now. van then leaves the restaurant with fiona and the clever boy he is, he knows he is being followed by someone. he tells zeke to go ahead and asks the guy to come out. it turns out that he is military police or it seems so. he tells van that they are actually looking for gold and that they are planning to find and sell it in the empire. he then shows them his partner, the gun sniper. showtime, van follows commander cunningham and monitors them. they had command wolves resting in the back to take out the blade liger if he makes a move. unknown to van, the military officer is actually in cahoots with commander cunningham."
