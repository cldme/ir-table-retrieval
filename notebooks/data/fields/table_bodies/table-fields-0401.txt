"reika is removed from the bathtub where she drowned. richard examines the body and finds that unlike steve's murder and the attack on rachel, reika had been bound with rope and duct tape and her clothes were soaking wet. richard analyzes the facts and deduces that the murder took place between 5 and 6 a.m. this cleared suitors donald hiblar and michael stewart along with the maid nonee. at that time, however, suitors dirk copeland and quentin mifune were not accounted for. dirk claimed he saw quentin heading in the direction of the bathroom but quentin denies entering. then, by accident, conan turns on the water and the shower head comes on. richard scolds and warns him he will get wet. with that statement, conan has figured out how reika was killed. he puts richard to sleep and proclaims he's solved the case. he asks the suitors to remove their jackets. conan notices where water stains are located on the men's shirts. conan deducts that donald hiblar is the murderer. first, donald rejoined steve in the search for reika, which gave him the perfect opportunity to murder him. next, he made it look like the murderer had cut the power and escaped through the window by causing a power surge and breaking the window. donald's next act was to drug rachel's tea. while everyone believed rachel was attacked for a reason, there was none, and donald had chosen a victim at random because all he wanted was a witness to confirm she was drowned the same way steve was. while it appeared that all three murders were done the same, each was unique in different ways. reika was tied up, duct taped and the shower-head was turned on to insure she drowned slowly and quietly, and thus donald's alibi. the evidence is on his shirt elbows where the water stained when he removed reika, as he rolled up his sleeves. he confesses and says sonja was murdered by steve and reika and this was revenge. nonee, while devastated at this revelation, disapproves of donald's actions."

"it's the christmas season and rachel, serena and conan are shopping and talking about, among other things, boyfriends. serena's new boyfriend/acquaintance is pop-star justin moon of the band lex. the three meet the band at kareoke and quickly discover that justin is little more than an arrogant, selfish person. justin's signature song, ""bloody venus"" comes on, and he steps up to sing. he rips his jacket in the beginning of the song, something he normally does. when the song ends, the caterer georgie brings in a spread. justin grabs a riceball and talks about breaking up the band and wanting to go solo. before he can finish another sentence, he collapses and dies. upon initial examination, conan smells cyanide and realizes this was murder, instigated by one of the band members. inspector meguire is called in. conan meanwhile examines the scene for any hints of motive. amber, lex's guitarist, is sighted as a suspect because of her love for justin. justin already had a girlfriend who was ""away for a while"" and called it quits. with no solid evidence though, meguire can't convict amber. he returns to the station empty-handed. conan notices a photograph in the room of another band. in the photograph is justin; sledge, the drummer of lex and two unknown women. sledge says one of the women is mazy, the manager of lex even though she looks nothing like the current mazy. using past evidence, conan has solved the case. meanwhile, the inspector gets a telephone call to meet him back at the karaoke room. he tells rachel and serena who are in the car with him on the drive that jimmy kudo has solved the case. back at the karaoke room, the song ""rudolph the red-nosed reindeer"" is playing over the loudspeaker. this song was what drove the murderer over the edge when justin requested it for her. the murderer is mazy. the evidence is in mazy's lex jacket. it's justin's lighter. mazy placed the cyanide on her jacket and switched her band jacket with justin's. when justin ripped his jacket of during ""bloody venus"", the cyanide was exposed. his death was hurried when he ate a riceball with his contaminated hand. mazy confesses and says that justin hated her after she had plastic surgery even though it was done to impress him. on the back of the photograph is a love song written by justin dedicated to mazy, making her realize he did still, in fact, love her. mazy realizes her mistake and bursts into tears."

"a librarian is hiding more than just foreign books in the shelves. conan and the detective boys sneak into the library at night after seeing police look for a corpse of a missing librarian. they see the director,tuttlebore, packing imported books that conan found wrapped up earlier into a briefcase. unaware of the children's presence, he boasts to himself of being able to hide the body of the missing librarian in the library without the police finding it. they decide to look for the remaining books that tuttlebore wasn't able to take with him. after an exhausting search, they realise that there is a middle row of books between the outside two that doesn't have a spine giving the impression of it being the opposite book. in each of these fakes they find packets of narcotics. realising that the body is on top of the elevator conan calls it up while manually opening the door. they find the dead body of the missing librarian but inside the elevator there is the director. after narrowly escaping him they set a trap for him which knocks him out."
